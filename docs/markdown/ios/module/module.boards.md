- To suggest boards containing content that a Pinner might like based on their engagement, interests, boards, demographic information, or other signals

## Best practices

- Always show two boards or sections per Module. More or less than two will display inconsistently within Module.
- Use any variations of the Board and Section component besides CTAs. Board CTAs can interfere with the selection of Module itself.

## Accessibility

People use Apple’s accessibility features, such as reduced transparency, VoiceOver, and increased text size, to personalize how they interact with their devices. Supporting these personalizations ensures that everyone has a great user experience. See Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines and documentation about accessibility for iOS:
